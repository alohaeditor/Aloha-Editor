# Output directory for processed CSS files and CSS-relative sprite images. The
# directory structure relative to root.dir.path will be preserved in the output
# directory. E.g. if CSS files are contained in the css/base directory of
# root.dir.path, the processed results will be written to
# output.dir.path/css/base. Also, CSS-relative sprite images will be written to
# the output directory. Sprite images with document-root-relative URLs will be
# written relative to the document.root.dir.path. 
#
# If the output.dir.path directory does not exist, it will be created. The 
# output.dir.path can be either absolute or relative to the current working 
# directory.
#
# You can leave this property empty, in which case the CSS files will be
# written next to the original CSS files with css.file.suffix, and sprite
# images will be written relative to CSS files.

# If you are using a non-empty output.dir.path, you might want to use an empty
# css.file.suffix.

# Color depth of sprites in the PNG format

#   AUTO: PNG color depth will be chosen automatically. If the sprite image
#         does not contain partial transparencies (alpha channel) and has less than
#         256 colors, PNG8 will be used. Otherwise, the sprite will be saved in
#         PNG24.
#   DIRECT: PNG sprites will always be saved in the PNG24 format.
#   INDEXED: PNG sprites will always be saved in the PNG8 format. If the sprite
#            image contains partial transparencies (alpha chanel) or has more than 255
#            colors, image quality loss may occur and appropriate warnings will be
#            issued.
