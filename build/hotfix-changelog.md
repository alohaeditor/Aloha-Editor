- **BUGFIX**: (blocks) The floating toolbar will now be shown when clicking
              inside of editables that are nested inside of standalone Empty
              blocks.

- **BUGFIX**: (ui) It is now possible to configure the toolbar to not float at
              all.

- **BUGFIX**: (format) It is no longer possible to use formatting hotkeys to
              apply disallowed formatting in an editable.

- **BUGFIX**: (contenthandler) The content sanitizer has been corrected to use
              the editable that is passed to it’s handler() function rather than
              the currently active aditable.

- **BUGFIX**: (headerids) Fixed generation of invalid HTML ID’s for headings when
              the headings start with a number.

- **BUGFIX**: (editable) Aloha.Editable.registerEvents(), which attaches
              necessary events to the given editable, has been introduced.  This
              is part of a bug fix for applications that intergrate Aloha Editor
              and need to re-attach events to editables.

- **BUGFIX**: (abbr) The abbreviation plugin will now use non-exclusive scopes
              to toggle the visibility of its controls. This makes it compatible
              with other plugins in terms of control visibility (e.g. when nesting
              abbreviations with links).

- **BUGFIX**: (wai-lang) The wai-lang plugin will now use non-exclusive scopes
              to toggle the visibility of its controls. This makes it compatible
              with other plugins in terms of control visibility (e.g. when nesting
              wai-lang with links).
