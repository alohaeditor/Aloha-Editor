- **ENHANCEMENT**: The change improves the software, but otherwise makes no
                   functional change to any feature.

- **BUGFIX**: With this change, paragraphs are no longer inserted when pressing Enter
              in editables that do not allow paragraphs to be contained inside (according
              to the HTML 5 standard). In this case, a linebreak is added instead.
