- **BUG**: formatlesspaste-plugin: Formatless Paste Plugin fixed to correctly
           process configuration settings.
- **BUG**: table-plugin: Ensures that the range is maintained when clicking
		   inside table cells.
- **BUG**: the underline button didn't show up in the toolbar
           after adding the 'u' in the format-plugin configuration.
- **BUG**: All repositories have been queried even if a target repository has been spezified. Now only the spezified repository is queried.
- **BUG**: core/aloha-links: Prevents yellow borders around aloha-links blocks
- **BUG**: link-plugin: link scope remains active after the selection leaves an anchor element
- **BUG**: blocks: The floating menu will appear when the editor double-clicks
           in an editable block.
- **BUG**: core/selection: Aloha no longer inadvertently removes ranges that
		   are outside of editables.
- **FEATURE**: core: makeClean is in the process of being obsoleted in favor of the aloha/ephemera.js module. See http://aloha-editor.org/guides/writing_plugins.html
- **ENHANCEMENT**: table plugin: IE fix -- the selection of multiple cells was not possible when the selection started in the text; there was no workaround so it's now possible to select coherent cells when you "shift-click" into the second cell of the range you want to select
- **BUG**: characterpicker: popup now follows the floating menu while scrolling
- **BUG**: dom utils: fixes potential bug that may cause attributes with the
	   slash '/' character in the name to appear in the result of
	   getContents().
- **BUG**: word content handler: Fixed handling of pasted MS Word content to
           not result in broken markup when the content contains tables with
           cells that are all empty.
- **BUG**: core/plugins: Fixed plugin initialization to ensure that the
           "aloha-ready" event is not fired before all plugins have notified
           that they are fully initialized.
- **BUG**: characterpicker & horizontalruler: Fixes icon styling to display
		   correct images event when a user-specified jquery ui stylsheet is
		   included in the page.
- **BUG**: block-plugin: Fixed activation of correct block when active editable
		   is changed using Keys (Tab, Shift-Tab) or programmatically.
- **BUG**: block-plugin: Fixed handling of copy & paste in editables that are
		   nested inside blocks. Before this fix, when pressing CTRL-C to copy
		   the current selection in an editable nested inside a block, the whole
		   block was selected and copied.
- **BUG**: table-plugin: Fixed the cursor problem with ie7. Now ie7 shows the 
           system default arrows.
