- **BUG**: plugin metaview: language annotations would result in background images being repeated over and over again - fixed that problem.
- **BUG**: format-plugin: removeFormat for quote and others (#577); enabled the useage of the u element (#580)
- **BUG**: core: Fixed copying of attributes when transforming DOM objects into other DOM objects (e.g. when transforming a list into a paragraph), which caused strange attributes to be written in IE, that caused editing problems (e.g. could not set cursor into paragraph, etc.)
- **BUG**: repository-browser: Some images for the repository browser were changed because Internet Explorer 7+8 don't know how to handle alpha in PNGs.
- **BUG**: repository-browser: Columns that are not sortable will now no longer be displayed like they were sortable.
- **BUG**: formatlesspaste-plugin: Fixed javascript error that ocurred when no custom editable configuration was set- **BUG**: dom-to-xhtml-plugin: When used in IE7 (or IE8 in IE7 mode), classes of elements were removed. This lead to unexpected behaviour with the BR-tags with class aloha-end-br, that are automatically added, when using the blockelementcontenthandler.
