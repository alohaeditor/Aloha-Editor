- **BUG**: added the del format button to the possible format plugin buttons

	The del button is not enabled by default. To enable it, it has to
	be configured. For example

	Aloha.settings.plugins.format.config = ['del', ...];

	See http://aloha-editor.org/guides/plugin_format.html

- **BUG**: characterpicker-plugin: Fixed a bug that when inserting a special character using the character picker plugin, the focus would be sometimes set to the start of the active editable (e.g. when inserting into a table cell).
- **BUG**: listenforcer-plugin: Fixed a bug that would only mark the first editable matching a configured selector as an enforced editable. Also when leaving an editable, we now remove the added list properly.
