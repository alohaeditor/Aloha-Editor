- **BUG**: characterpicker-plugin: Fixed a bug that when inserting a special character using the character picker plugin, the focus would be sometimes set to the start of the active editable (e.g. when inserting into a table cell).
- **BUG**: listenforcer-plugin: Fixed a bug that would only mark the first editable matching a configured selector as an enforced editable. Also when leaving an editable, we now remove the added list properly.
- **BUG**: floatingmenu: Fixed a bug in the floating menu that the position would not be adjusted if the height of the floating menu changed. This is needed in the topalign mode to not hide parts of the editable.
- **FEATURE**: metaview: We now also display HR tags in the metaview. We also removed the dependency to the flag-icons plugin.
- **FEATURE**: list-plugin: When transforming a list from ul to ol or back all sub elements that are selected are also transformed.
