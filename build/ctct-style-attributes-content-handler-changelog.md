- **FEATURE**: A Style Attribute Content Handler has been added to the common content handler plugin collection.
               The Style Attribute Content Handler will remove all unsupported style attribute items recursively
               from all elements in the supplied content.  The set of supported style attribute items is
               configured in the same manner as other content handler plugins via config in
               Aloha.settings.contentHandler.handler.styleattribute.
