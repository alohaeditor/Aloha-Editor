Link-Plugin: When targetregex and target were set, the target was automatically changed
when a link to a repository item was selected, even if the item was not changed.
This has been fixed now, the target must only be automatically changed according to the settings,
when the href (for external links) or the item (when linking to a repository item) is actually changed.
