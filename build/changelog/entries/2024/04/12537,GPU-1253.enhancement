Various settings for plugins and the UI Toolbar have been changed.

Noteworthy changes for the @Aloha.settings.toolbar@:

* Tabs require an @id@, and @label@ property and optionally an @icon@.
* Tab component slots (@components@) can be defined by either @string@ or as @{ slot: string; scope: string | string[] }@ elements.

For full type definitions, check the @ui/settings@ file.
