The formatless paste contenthandler (used by the formatless paste plugin) and the generic contenthandler
did not clean any content, when an aloha block was found in the pasted contents.
This has been changed, so that the content handlers will clean everything else, but will still leave the
aloha blocks (identified by the class aloha-block) untouched.
