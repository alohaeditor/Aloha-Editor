When Drag & Drop was disabled, blocks with duplicate IDs inside nested editables
would sometimes get the class @ui-state-disabled@ preventing any interaction
with them.

Note that blocks with duplicate IDs are not supported in Aloha-Editor since this
implies invalid HTML markup. This fix is just intended to prevent certain subsequent
errors when duplicate blocks are already present.
