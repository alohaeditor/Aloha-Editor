The behaviour of DELETE and BACKSPACE has been fixed:
If nothing is deleted, because the next/previous element is a block,
the current selection is not changed. This fixes problems in Internet Explorer
where after pressing DELETE when the cursor right before a block, the selection
would be moved into the block, which prevented further editing.
