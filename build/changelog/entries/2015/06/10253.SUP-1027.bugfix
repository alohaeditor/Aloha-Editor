A bug with the triggering of the item-change event caused custom sidebar info 
fields, which have been specified in the settings for the link plugin, to not 
be set when a link is selected and the sidebar opened afterwards. This has 
been fixed now by triggering the item-change event also when a null item is 
selected (that is the selection is changed from an element that has an 
associated repository browser item to an element that does not have an 
associated repository browser item).
