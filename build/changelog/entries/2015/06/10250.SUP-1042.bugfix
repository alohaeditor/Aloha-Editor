Several issues of the videoblock plugin have been fixed:
* During editing, the iframe to embed the video is replaced by an image showing the preview image
* Internet Explorer will no longer show it's own resize handles, when a video block is selected
* When getting the contents of an editable (in order to save it), all additional markup added to make video blocks editable will cleanly be removed
* It is now possible to paste more than just a single video URL. All URLs will be transformed to blocks, everything else will be pasted.
