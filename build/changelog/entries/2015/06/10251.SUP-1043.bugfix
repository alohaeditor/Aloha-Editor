Insertion of br Tags was still possible (by pressing Shift-Enter),
if br was forbidden by content rules. This has been fixed now.
When br tags are forbidden, but p Tags are allowed,
pressing Enter or Shift-Enter will insert a paragraph (if possible without violating the HTML specification).
If both p and br are forbidden (or not possible), Enter or Shift-Enter will just be ignored.
