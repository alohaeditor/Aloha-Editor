Some content that was pasted in Internet Explorer 11 coming from newer versions
of Microsoft Word resulted in newlines instead of white space being inserted
into the editables. These newlines get removed during saving as is required for
perticular part types resulting in unintended join of words at times.
This issue has now been fixed.
