Table-plugin: When selecting text in a table cell using the mouse,
the whole cell will no longer be selected when moving the mouse cursor over areas of the cell,
that do not have contents (e.g. near the cell borders or between paragraphs).
In order to select a single cell, the user needs to hold the SHIFT-key while clicking into the cell.
