table-plugin: WAI input stays when you click on it.

WAI input disappeared because of a selection issue with mouse-up event. Mouse-up event was stopped
if a cell is selected. Mouseup event should not be stopped because it is used in the
jquery.aloha.js file (jquery.aloha.js:207) for initializing the selection.
