Added a new block implementation of Aloha Editor blocks, which 
				   doesn't render any tag fill icons or borders. This is useful for 
				   tags that should be editable with Aloha Editor.

				   To use this block type, just wrap your tag content in a <div> 
				   with the following attribute: 

				   data-aloha-block-type="EmptyBlock"
