h3. Release Lifecycle

h4. Feature Release

For every feature release a new release branch will be created. This branch must be named using the targeted release version. If you want to release 0.20.0 it will be named: +release-0.20.0+. The release branch will always be created from the +dev+ branch. 



h4. Hotfix Release

A hotfix release can be done from an existing hotfix branch. The hotfix level of the version will be raised one leve. (eg. 0.20.0 -> 0.20.1)

h4. Post Release Steps
* After a release has been done the tagged version will be merged into the master branch.
* A hotfix branch for the release will be created in which hotfixes can be applied.
* The tagged version will be merged into the dev branch. Please note that the dev version should always be one level above the current major release version. (eg. current stable is 0.20.0 than the dev branch version would be 0.30.0-dev.)  

h3. Practical Maven Feature Release Example For Version 0.20.0

1. Switch into the dev branch.
<shell>
  git checkout dev
</shell>

2. Create a new release branch.
<shell>
  git checkout -b release-0.20.0
</shell>
 
3. Prepare the release and define the release version. 
<shell>
  mvn release:prepare
</shell>
Next development version will be 0.20.1-SNAPSHOT. We just raise the bugfix level.

4. Test the created preview release in all supported browsers.

5. Perform the maven release. This will push the artifact to archiva.
<shell>
  git add .
  git commit -m "Maven release prepare"
  git push origin release-0.20.0
  mvn release:perform
</shell>

6. Checkout the master branch and merge the tag into that branch
<shell>
  git checkout master
  git merge tags/release-0.20.0
</shell>

8. Update the dev branch
<shell> 
  git checkout dev
  git pull hotfix-0.20.0
</shell>

9. Update the dev branch version to 0.21.0-dev-SNAPSHOT
<shell>
  mvn release:update-versions -DdevelopmentVersion=0.21-dev-SNAPSHOT -DautoVersionSubmodules=true
</shell>

h3. Practical Maven Hotfix Release Example 

1. Create a new hotfix branch from master
<shell>  
  git checkout -b hotfix-0.20.1 master
  git push origin hotfix-0.20.1
</shell>

2. Rename the old release/hotfix branch
  git checkout release-0.20.0
  git checkout -b release-0.20.0-closed
  git branch -d release-0.20.0
  git push upstream release-0.20.0-closed
  git push upstream :release-0.20.0

3. Continue with step 3 from the feature release example
