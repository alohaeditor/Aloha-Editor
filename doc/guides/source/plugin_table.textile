h2. The Table Plugin

The Table Plugin will allow you to edit tables within your contents. You
can do pretty much everything that you'd expect from editing tables,
like adding and deleting rows and columns as well as merging and
splitting cells. You can use the tab key to jump from one cell to the
next.

h3. Configuration

The table configuration allows for some special settings:
<javascript>
Aloha.settings.plugins.table: {
	// all elements with no specific configuration are not allowed to insert tables
	config : [ 'table' ],
	// the table summary is editable in the sidebar
	summaryinsidebar : true,
	// the following settings allow the user to apply specific classes to
	// either the whole table or a column or row. The name is used as a
	// class attribute, while the iconClass is applied as a class attribute
	// to style the buttons
	tableConfig : [
		{ name:'hor-minimalist-a' },
		{ name:'box-table-a' },
		{ name:'hor-zebra' },
	],
	columnConfig : [
			{ name: 'table-style-bigbold',  iconClass: 'aloha-button-col-bigbold' },
			{ name: 'table-style-redwhite', iconClass: 'aloha-button-col-redwhite' }
	],
	rowConfig : [
			{ name: 'table-style-bigbold',  iconClass: 'aloha-button-row-bigbold' },
			{ name: 'table-style-redwhite', iconClass: 'aloha-button-row-redwhite' }
