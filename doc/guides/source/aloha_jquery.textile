h3. Using embedded jQuery Version

The full bundled version of Aloha Editor contains a copy of jQuery to be independent from other libraries. This embedded jQuery version will not interfere with any other version of jQuery loaded before or after Aloha Editor.

h3. Using a custom jQuery Version

When your web site already uses jQuery (in a version that is compatible with Aloha Editor), you might want to configure Aloha Editor to use that jQuery instead of its own. This can be done by setting +Aloha.settings.jQuery+ *before* Aloha Editor is loaded.

<html>
<!-- Load your own version of jQuery -->
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script>
<!-- Tell Aloha Editor to use this jQuery version -->
<script language="javascript">
	var Aloha = {
		settings: {
			jQuery: $
		}
	};
</script>
<!-- Load Aloha Editor -->
<script src="/javascripts/aloha/lib/aloha.js"></script>
</html>

NOTE: Aloha Editor will attache some jQuery plugins to the jQuery version it uses. This has to be considered when telling Aloha Editor to use a customer jQuery version.
