h2. DOM to XHTML Plugin

The dom-to-xhtml plugin provides a more XHTML conformant
serialization than element.innerHTML for editable.getContents().

h3. Overview

The internal serializer walks a DOM tree and generates a XML fragment of
the tree that doesn't violate the basic well-formedness rules of
attribute values must be quoted and elements must be closed.

The plugin tries to make the result XHTML and HTML comformant:
* element and attribute names are lowercased,
* certain elements are not serialized with an end tag (&lt;br/>, &lt;img/>),
* boolean attributes that are true are serialized like checked="checked"

Also, empty attributes (for example value="") will not be serialized at
all (will not appear in the serialization). There is not yet a definite
reason for this, so it may be changed at some time.

The result may still violate HTML or XHTML schemas because all elements
and attributes that are encountered in the DOM are serialized, whether
or not they are allowed according to a schema. Element nesting rules
aren't checked either.

h3. Usage

It suffices to include the dom-to-xhtml plugin in the plugin list of the
Aloha-Editor script tag.

When the plugin is initialized, it will automatically replace the
default editable serializer, which has the effect that calls to
editable.getContents() return a valid XML fragment.

The serialization functions can also be used directly, for example:

<javascript>
    Aloha.require(['dom-to-xhtml/dom-to-xhtml'], function(DomToXhtml) {	
        DomToXhtml.contentsToXhtml(elementNode);
        DomToXhtml.nodeToXhtml(anyDomNode);
    });
</javascript>

h3. Configuration

This plugin does not provide any configuration settings.

h3. Known Issues

There are some known issues especially with Internet Explorer. These
issues are documented more in detail in the source code. Some best
practices to avoid these issues:

* IE - don't use newer HTML elements on older Internet Explorer versions,
* IE - don't use namespaces,
* IE - if you have to use namespaces, don't use default namespaces, only prefixes,
  and make prefixes and element and attribute names all lowercase,
  and don't use any title elements, or similar HTML elements that can't
  validly appear in the body of a HTML document, not even in a non-HTML
  namespace,
* IE - don't expect whitespace to be preserved correctly except in &lt;pre> elements,
* IE - but don't use white-space:pre CSS styles (and similar whitespace modifying styles),
  or expect whitespace to sometimes be preserved and sometimes not,
* IE7 only - expect URLs in href and src attributes to be turned into absolute URLs,
* all browsers - don't expect comments, conditional comments, processing
  instructions or CDATA sections to be preserved correctly.
