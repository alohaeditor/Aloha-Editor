h3. Building  - Aloha Building

h4. Debian Linux / Mac OS X

* Install nodejs
See: http://nodejs.org

* Install npm
See: http://npmjs.org
<shell>
curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
</shell>


* Invoke Building:
<shell>
cd alohaeditor
mvn3 clean package
</shell>

You probably want to ommit building of the api and guides:
<shell>
mvn3 clean package -DbareMode=true
</shell>

You can also build just the css:
<shell>
mvn3 generate-sources
</shell>

The resulting css will be generated in src/css/aloha.css.

h4. Other OS: 
* Microsoft Windows: Not yet supported

h4. Customized builds:

Aloha-Editor uses maven to build a distributable package (includes
documentation etc.). To build just the javascript, it suffices to invoke
"r.js":https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/ from the command line. For example

<shell>
node build/r.js -o build/aloha/build.js
</shell>

To customize the build to your needs, you can modify the build profile
in build/aloha/build.js. The most likely customization you want to make
is to remove or add plugins from the include property of the 'aloha'
module definition.

To include i18n files in your build, define the locale property. If the
locale property is not defined, the appropriate i18n files will be
loaded dynamically by requirejs. Remember to configure Aloha.locale
as well.

Unless you ask for plugins to be loaded that are not defined in the
build profile, or use a locale that was not defined during building, no
additional files should be downloaded by requirejs. In the future
requirejs may be replaced with an AMD stub such that requirejs is not
necessary for production deployments.

Css building can be customized by adding or removing entries in
src/css/aloha-common-extra.css. If you removed or added plugins in the
r.js build profile, you also want to add or remove the appropriate css
import statement. Then, run

<shell>
mvn3 generate-sources
</shell>

The resulting css will be generated in src/css/aloha.css.

If you want to redefine modules in the build profile, for example if you
want to use your own jqueryui, please first read "Custom jQuery,
jQueryUI and other modules":using_aloha.html
