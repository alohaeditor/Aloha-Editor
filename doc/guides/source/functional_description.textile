h3. Paragraphs & Line Breaks

Paragraphs and line breaks are a fundamental part of editing text.
Aloha Editor will decide for you which kind of line break to use
if certain preconditions are met. Both kind of line breaks can be
created using the enter key.

Pressing enter when contents are selected will remove those contents.

h4. Creating Paragraphs +<p>+

To have the enter key create a new paragraph the cursor has to be
located inside an existing paragraph. Every time you press enter,
the existing paragraph will be split at the cursor position
resulting in two paragraphs.

h4. Creating Line Breaks +<br>+

If the cursor is within an editable, but no wrapping paragraph
can be detected a +<br>+ is inserted instead of a +<p>+. If you
are inside a paragraph you may insert a line break at any time
by pressing +Shift+++Enter+.

h3. Deletion of Contents

If you want to delete contents you may use the +Del+ Button to
issue a +forwardDelete+ command or the +Backspace+ key to trigger
a +delete+ command.

If contents have been selected both +forwardDelete+ and +delete+
will remove the selected contents in the same manner.

h4. +forwardDelete+

Forward delete means deleting characters that are right of your
current caret position. If the selection is collapsed every time
the +Del+ key is hit a single character will be deleted. If you
keep pressing +Del+ and an inline formatting (like +<b>+) is encountered, the
formatting will be kept for the remaining characters unless all
of the formatted content is gone. If you encounter a phrasing
element like a +<h1>+ tag the contents will be unwrapped before
character deletion is continued.

h4. +delete+

The +delete+ command will delte characters left of your current
caret position. Deleting inline formattings will work the same
way as with +forwardDelete+, but deleting phrasing elements will
open up the end of the phrasing element which will then engulf
the rest of the contents until the end of the current paragraph
or comparable wrapping phrasing element is hit.
