h3. Toolbar integration

You may embed the toolbar in a given container in your site or let it float. If you don&#8217;t provide a container the toolbar will append a <tt>div</tt> element as last element of the documents body and position the toolbar as defined.

<javascript>
	Aloha.ui.toolbar.appendTo('#aloha-toolbar');
</javascript>

h3. Component configuration

You may define the name of your tabs and groups as key.  The following example defines a toolbar with the 3 tabs <strong>format</strong>, <strong>insert</strong> and <strong>link</strong>. The name of the tabs and groups is passed to <code>i18n</code> which translates them to the currently displayed language. The <strong>format</strong> tab has the two groups <strong>inline</strong> and <strong>paragraph</strong>. You may define the components that should be rendered by the group.

<javascript>
Aloha.settings.toolbar = {
    tabs: {
    	format : {
    		inline: [ 'bold', 'italic', 'striketrough',
    			'abbreviation', 'spacer', 'metaview' ]
			paragraph: [ 'formatparagraph' ]
    	},
		insert: {
			general: [ 'insertable', 'charakterpicker', 'insertlink' ]
    		media: [ 'image', 'video' ]
    	},
    	link: {
    		link: [ 'editlink' ]
    	} 
    }
};
</javascript>
