and it changes its items depending on the acitvated editable.

h3. Sidebar integration

You may embed the toolbar in a given container in your site or let it float. If you don't provide a container the toolbar will append a +div+ element as last element of the documents body and position the toolbar as defined.


The Sidebar provides *tabs*. You may define the name of your tabs as key. 
The following example defines a toolbar with the 2 tabs *attributes* and *comments*. The name of the tabs is passed to @i18n@ which translates them to the currently displayed language. The *attributes* tab has on component *attributepanel*. You may define the components that should be rendered by the group.

<javascript>
Aloha.settings.sidebar = {
    tabs: {
    	attributes : [ 'attributepanel'],
		comments: [ 'comments' ]
	}
}
</javascript>




<javascript>
	Aloha.ui.toolbar.appendTo('#aloha-toolbar');
</javascript> 

h3. Component configuration

You may define the name of your tabs and groups as key. 
The following example defines a toolbar with the 3 tabs *format*, *insert* and *link*. The name of the tabs and groups is passed to @i18n@ which translates them to the currently displayed language. The *format* tab has the two groups *inline* and *paragraph*. You may define the components that should be rendered by the group.

<javascript>
Aloha.settings.sidebar = {
    tabs: {
    	format : {
    		inline: [ 'bold', 'italic', 'striketrough',
    			'abbreviation', 'spacer', 'metaview' ]
			paragraph: [ 'formatparagraph' ]
    	},
		insert: {
			general: [ 'insertable', 'charakterpicker', 'insertlink' ]
    		media: [ 'image', 'video' ]
    	},
    	link: {
    		link: [ 'editlink' ]
    	} 
    }
};
</javascript>
