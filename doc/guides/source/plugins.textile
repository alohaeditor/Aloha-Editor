h2. Aloha Plugins

Plugins are optional components of Aloha Editor.

Most plugins can be configured via @Aloha.settings.plugins@ and some
plugins provide UI components (buttons, input fields, ...) that can be
added to the toolbar or sidebar.

h3. Usage

To load a plugin, it must be listed in the @data-aloha-plugins@ attribute
of the aloha script tag. For example, to load the format and link plugin the
script tag would look like the following

<html>
<script src="javascripts/aloha/aloha.js" data-aloha-plugins="common/format, common/link"></script>
</html>

To load plugins, css and localization files, Aloha-Editor tries to
determine a baseUrl. The baseUrl is used to lookup at least the
following files:

* @baseUrl/aloha/nls/18n@
* @baseUrl/plugins/common/*@
* @baseUrl/aloha.css@

The baseUrl is determined by looking at the following places

* the @Aloha.settings.baseUrl@ settings
* the first occureancy of a script tag, where the file name is @aloha.js@
* the first script tag where a data attribute @data-aloha-plugins@ is added

If all this fails Aloha Editor may not be able to load properly.

plugins will be moved to a separate repository at a future date as they
are too specific to warrant the overhead of supporting and maintaining
them as part of Aloha-Editor.
