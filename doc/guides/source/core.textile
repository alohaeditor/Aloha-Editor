h4. aloha-smart-content-changed Event

A smart content change occurs when a special editing action, or a
combination of interactions are performed by the user during the
course of editing within an editable.
The smart content change event would therefore signal to any
component that is listening to this event, that content has been
inserted into the editable that may need to be prococessed in a
special way.
The smart content change event is also triggered after an idle period that follows
rapid, basic changes to the contents of an editable such as when the user is typing.
