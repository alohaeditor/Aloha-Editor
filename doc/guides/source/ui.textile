be the next generation UI for Aloha Editor. Your feedback is welcome!

h3. What is the Aloha Editor UI

WARNING: how will scopes work?

The Aloha Editor UI is a plugin and provides 2 containers (toolbar, sidebar), a messaging interface and componenttypes to build a user interface.
You may use, extend and configure these or implement your own. 
Aloha Editor UI provides further component types and some components. A component is an instance of a componnent type. Any 
component may accept other components depending on its implementation. Usually plugins provide components such as the +format+
plugin provides the +bold+ component. 
 
* The "+Aloha.toolbar+":toolbar.html provides context sensitive interaction items for main use. The toolbar contains tabs and tabs contain 
groups. Each group may contain components.
* The "+Aloha.sidebar+":sidebar.html provides attribute modification for more advanced users or extended functionality such as commenting.
The sidebar contains tabs and each tab may contain components.
* The "+Aloha.message+":message.html provides an interaction container, which informs users about status or other issues.
* "+Aloha.componenttypes+":componenttypes.html are used as a basis to build your own UI components such as buttons and input fields.

h3. Configuring the Aloha Editor UI

Every interface or component may have its own configuration settings. The containers 
and components come with default settings which are accessable in the namespace of the 
container or component. The values of settings are implementation specific.

<javascript>
Aloha.defaults.container = { name: value };
Aloha.defaults.component = { name: value };
</javascript>

You may define your site specific runtime settings may defining the settings for each container or 
component. The settings are assigned during the *initialization* stop of plugins. 

INFO: see plugin lifecycle. 
 

<javascript>
Aloha.settings.container = { name: value };
Aloha.settings.component = { name: value };
</javascript>

Further more every editable may have its own settings which you may pass as argument to the 
+$( 'selector' ).aloha( settings )+ method. 

<javascript>
$( '#editable' ).aloha({
	container: { name: value }
	component: { name: value } 
});
</javascript>
