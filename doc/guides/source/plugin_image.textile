h2. The Image Plugin

The Image Plugin will allow for basic image manipulation right within your content:

* resize (by dragging and entering values)
* resizing with fixed aspect ratio
* resetting the image to it's initial state
* Image cropping
* Insert a Image
* Support for dragging the image around
* Support for changing the title, src and alt attributes
* Support for resizing the image
* Support for changing the image padding

NOTE: You need a server-sided script like image magick which will handle actual cropping for you.
