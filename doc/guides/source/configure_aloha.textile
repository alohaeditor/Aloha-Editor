h3. Configuring the FloatingMenu

The floating menu can be adapted to your needs by configuring tabs, groups and buttons. You may reassemble all of the existing buttons provided by plugins in any combination you want.

INFO: A button may only be added once to the configuration. Adding the same button twice will yield no results exept raising a warning message.

The following simple example should help to understand how to configure the FloatingMenu. Basically, all you have to do is define an array of button names (those are provided by plugins). As you might have noticed, groups may be named in our example ("flow", "phrasing" or "first"). However, at this time naming groups yields no visual result in the current FloatingMenu. It will just help you structure your configuration.

<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
Aloha.settings.toolbar = {
	tabs : {
		// will generate a tab labeled "formatting"
		formatting : {
			// group "flow"
			flow : [ 'b', 'em', 'u' ],
			// group "phrasing"
			phrasing : [ 'phrasing' ] // "phrasing" is the name of a 
			// MultiSplitButton from the format plugin, which contains 
			// elements like h1 ...
		},
		// will generate another tab labeled "insert"
		insert : {
			// as mentioned group names are not displayed anywhere,
			// so you might pick an arbitrary name
			first : [ 'image', 'insertLink' ]
		}
	},
	components : {
		// the phrasing MultiSplitButton is configured the same way 
		// as groups are
		phrasing : [ 'h1', 'h2', 'h3' ]
	}
};
