h2. Commands Plugin

The Commands Plugin adds additional commands to the Aloha Editor core. Currently it only provides the +inserthtml+ command which the "Paste Plugin":plugin_paste.html and many others will make use of. There is no configuration or settings for the Commands Plugin. For more information see our guide on "Aloha Commands":using_commands.html

The common/commands plugin depends on the common/contenthandler plugin.
