h2. The Proxy Plugin

This plugin provides a proxy script for using external resources via AJAX.

Because of cross-origin restrictions it's sometimes not possible to access external data via AJAX.
Currently there's a PHP proxy script available.

This plugin does not provide any User Interface and is ment to be used by other plugins.

The URL to the proxy script is available as +Aloha.settings.proxy+ and looks like +aloha/path/plugins/extra/proxy/adapter/proxy.php?url=+ -- so you can use it like this:

<javascript>
	jQuery.ajax({
		type: "GET",
		url: Aloha.settings.proxy + "http://www.google.com/ig/api?stock=" + stockSymbol,
		dataType: "xml",
		success: parseXml
	});
</javascript>
