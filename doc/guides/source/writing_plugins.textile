h2. Writing Plugins

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

* Create plugins to adjust Aloha to your needs.
* Load and define dependencies with RequireJS.

h3. What's a plugin?

A plugin extends Aloha with new behavior and can be loaded by the user. It should be self-contained, so that it can be used for other Aloha installations.

A full-blown plugin has the following file structure:

* @pluginname@
** @css@ - Stylesheets
** @doc@ - Documentation, if exists
** @img@ - Image assets
** @lib@ - RequireJS modules
** @nls@ - Localization files, see "Localization and I18N":#localization
** @test@ - Unit tests
** @vendor@ - Legacy JavaScript dependencies, not managed by RequireJS
** @package.json@ - Metadata about your package, in CommonJS format

All file names are, by convention, lowercase.

h3. A basic Aloha plugin

For a very basic plugin, nothing else than a plugin module in @lib/@ has to be
created. The module is named as +pluginname-plugin.js+.

<javascript filename="aloha/plugins/custom/helloworld/lib/helloworld-plugin.js">
define(
['core/plugin'],
function(Plugin) {
    "use strict";

    return Plugin.create('myplugin', {
        init: function() {
            // Executed on plugin initialization
        },
        destroy: function() {
            // Executed when this plugin is unloaded
        }
    });
});
</javascript>

This code requires the core plugin module (which defines the @Plugin@ class) and creates a plugin with the name @myplugin@.

Loading the new plugin is easy, just add it to the list of plugins in the main
script tag loading Aloha:

<html>
<head>
	<script src="javascripts/aloha/require.js"
			data-main="javascripts/aloha/aloha.js"
			id="aloha-script-include"
			data-plugins="common/format,custom/myplugin">
	</script>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="javascripts/aloha/aloha.css" type="text/css">
</head>
</html>

NOTE: If your plugin should be published to the public you should consider writing a @package.json@ file with metadata about the plugin. Furthermore, the name of your plugin shoulf be globally unique.

h3. RequireJS modules explained

We use "RequireJS":http://requirejs.org to manage JavaScript dependencies, that's why some
basic understanding is very helpful. By using RequireJS, we gain some nice benefits: First, we the dependency management between JavaScript files is done for us, meaning they are included in the correct order. Second, we do not pollute the global namespace, allowing tricks like "loading two different versions":http://requirejs.org/docs/requirements.html#8 of Aloha on a single page.

The basic element of RequireJS is a so called +module+ which is one file that defines and exports a class or other JavaScript value. This reference can be used in other modules by *requiring* that module.

INFO: Roughly, a RequireJS module is the same as a JavaScript @Class@, but without a global variable.

In the following example, we define two modules. The first module @foo@ defines a class with a method @doSomething()@. The second module @bar@ has a dependency to @foo@, and RequireJS injects what has been returned by @foo@.

<javascript filename="myplugin/lib/foo.js">
define(
[],
function() {
    "use strict";
    return Class.extend({
        doSomething: function() {
        }
    });
});
</javascript>

<javascript filename="myplugin/lib/bar.js">
define(
['myplugin/foo'],
function(Foo) {
    "use strict";
    var fooInstance = new Foo();
    fooInstance.doSomething();
});
</javascript>

Note that a module does not need to define its own name, it is simply named by its location on the file system.

Modules are created using +define(dependencies, callback)+, where the first parameter @dependencies@ is a list of other RequireJS modules this plugin needs in order to function properly. The second parameter is @callback@ is a function which is executed *as soon as all dependencies are loaded*. The first dependency is passed to the @callback@ as first parameter, the second dependency as the second, and so on.

NOTE: Circular dependencies need some special treatment. It is most often a sign of bad code, but if you need to do this, follow the "guide at the RequireJS website":http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#circular.

So, at which place does Aloha look up modules? We'll explain this with a few examples:

|_. Definition in RequireJS |_. File Name |
| @myplugin/foo@ | @path_to_bundle/myplugin/lib/foo.js@ <br /> Including other RequireJS modules is the most common case |
| @myplugin/vendor/legacy_lib@ | @path_to_bundle/myplugin/vendor/legacy_lib.js@ <br /> Include a legacy library |
| @css!myplugin/css/cssfile.css@ | @path_to_bundle/myplugin/css/cssfile.css@ <br /> Includes the CSS file in the document @<head>@. Explained "here":#including-css-files |
| @i18n!myplugin/nls/i18n.js@ | depends on current language, see "Localization":#localization for details. |

The bundle name is not part of the RequireJS definition, as this is installation-specific. You as plugin developer should not care about where other plugins are located on disk.

h3. Classes and Extension Mechanisms

We use the class definition syntax of "John Resig":http://ejohn.org - slightly adjusted. This means you can create a new class with +Class.extend({ ....})+. The following example shows how to create and instanciate a class, and how the constructor is called.

<javascript>
var Greeter = Class.extend({
    name: null,

    _constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    },

    greet: function() {
        alert('Good Morning ' + this.name);
    }
});
var greeterInstance = new Greeter('Christopher');
greeterInstance.greet(); // alerts "Good Morning Chistopher"
</javascript>

h3. Including CSS files

When your Aloha plugin needs some CSS files, you should place them in the @css@ folder of your plugin. Furthermore, your plugin should depend on the CSS file as follows:

<javascript filename="myplugin/lib/myplugin-plugin.js">
define(
['core/plugin', 'css!myplugin/css/myplugin.css'],
function(Plugin) {
    "use strict";

    return Plugin.create('myplugin', {
        init: function() {
            // Executed on plugin initialization
        },
        destroy: function() {
            // Executed when this plugin is unloaded
        }
    });
});
</javascript>

The key part is to set a dependency on +css!myplugin/css/myplugin.css+. Then, the loader knows that it needs to load the @myplugin.css@ stylesheet into the current website.

NOTE: By default, CSS file loading is *asynchronous*, meaning that CSS files are loaded in the background, independently from the JavaScript loading.
If you for some reason depend on the fact that a CSS file is included at a particular point in time (calles *synchronous loading*), you need to append the parameter @!nowait@ to the dependency, so the whole dependency looks like  @css!myplugin/css/myplugin.css!nowait@

h3. Lifecycle of Plugins

WARNING: not yet done.

Let's begin by installing the Aloha Editor library. There are two ways to choose right now.

INFO: Actually you don’t "install" Aloha Editor, since it is neither a standalone CMS nor an HTML editor to create
websites. It is a JavaScript Library which has to be embedded and integrated in your web application.
Use it like a supersonic textarea. You can edit any DOM element with this supersonic textarea,
but you need to care about configuration and storage.
