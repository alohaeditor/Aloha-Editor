h3. Usage

You may either select existing contents to be turned into a list, or just click the ordered or unordered list button to start a new one.

You can remove lists by clicking the applied list type a second time, which will turn individual list items back into paragraphs.

The List Plugin will indent list items when pressing the tab-key, or outdent when pressing shift-tab.

NOTE: The list plugin will turn existing paragraphs into list items. Single lines separated by @<br>@ tags will NOT be turned into separate list items.

	config : [ 'ol', 'ul' ],
};
</javascript>
