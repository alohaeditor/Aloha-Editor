h2. The Validation Plugin

The validation plugin allows editables to be validated against predefined tests
for correctness, and then have specific processes be undertaken in response to
the result of these tests.

endprologue.

h3. Dependencies

In order to use editable validation in Aloha Editor, the first thing you will
need to do is to include the @extra/validation@ and @common/contenthandler@
plugins in your @data-aloha-plugins@ list in the script tag which loads
@aloha.js@.

<html>
	<script src="aloha.js" data-aloha-plugins"common/highlighteditables,
	                                          extra/validation"></script>
</html>

NOTE: @common/contenthandler@ is must be included for @extra/validation@ to
	  work because the validation plugin uses
	  "Content Handlers":plugin_contenthandler.html internally and therefore
	  depends on them.

h3. Configuration

Loading the necessary plugins will make the validation features available in
Aloha Editor, but that alone will not result in any editables being validated.
For that to happen, you must configure which editables you wish to be
validated, and what tests to run on each editable to validated it.

At least two properties must be configured in the
@Aloha.settings.plugins.validation@ object for you to start seeing validation
at work: *@config@*, which indicates *what* should be validated and *how*
validity is tested, and at least one of either *@hooks@*, @channels@, or
@events@, which will indicate *when* validation should be run.

h4. *@config@*

@config@ is an object that maps strings of jQuery selectors against functions
or regular expressions which will test the validity of any editable that is
matched by the selector

NOTE: You may be interested know that an editable is "matched" by a selector
	  when an editable and a selector string has an
	  "$.fn.is&#40;&#41;":http://api.jquery.com/is/ relationship.

*Example:*

<javascript>
	Aloha.settings.plugins.validation = {
		config: {

			// Tests all editables.
			// Editable is invalid if it contains any <script>, or <style>
			// elements.
			"*": function (content, editable, $) {
				0 === $('<div>' + content + '</div>').find('script,style');
			},

			// Tests editables with the id "weekday".
			// Editable is invalid unless the entirety of its contents is a
			// name of one of the weekdays.
			"#weekday": /^(monday|tuesday|wednesday|thursday|friday)$/i

			// Will be ignored with an error.
			"span": "<b>Lorem ipsum</b>"
		}
	}
</javascript>

It is important to know that an editable with the id "weekday" matches both
configured selectors and therefore will be subject to both validation tests.
Notice that both functions, and regular expression are allowed as validation
tests, but anything else is invalid configuration.

WARNING: Anything other than a function or a regular expression will result in
		 an error message, and that test being ignored.  So the above example
		 will cause the following message to be logged in the console: *@validation/validation-plugin: Encountered property "<b>Lorem ipsum</b>" of type string when a RegExp or Function is required.@*

Consider the test function:
<javascript>
	function (content, editable, $) {
		0 === $('<div>' + content + '</div>').find('script,style');
	},
</javascript>

There are a couple of things about the above example function to that are
important to take note of as rules:

 * All such functions receive 3 parameters: The first arguments is a string,
   the second, an Aloha.Editable object, and the third is a refernce to the
   jQuery that is used by Aloha Editor internally.
 * All such functions must be a predicate (returns truthy or falsey values).
 * The function is a "pure" function--meaning that it does not alter external
   state outside of itself.
 * The function is not asynchonous.
 * The function is relatively cheap, and not space/time-complex.

So the correct signature form of the function will look like this (in "Google
Closure Compiler
Annotation":https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler form):
*@function(string, Aloha.Editable, jQuery):boolean@*

WARNING: It is strongly discouraged for your tests to alter the parameters that
         are passed to it, or any external state.

h4. *@events@, @hooks@, and @channels@*

It is possible to have validation be triggered automatically at predefined
interaction points using one or more of the properties @events@, @hooks@, or
@channels@.

Each one is a list of strings of PubSub channels, events names, or content
handler triggers hooks.

*Example:*

<javascript>
	Aloha.settings.plugins.validation = {

		// Validate the involved editable when one of these content handling
		// triggers is fired.
		hooks: ['initEditable', 'smartContentChange'],

		// Validate the active editable when this event is fired.
		events: ['aloha-editable-deactivated'],

		// Validte the active editable when a message is published to this
		// channel.
		channels: ['aloha.selection.context-change']
	}
</javascript>

h4. *@onValidation@*

If you provide a @onValidation@ function in your settings, each time that an
editable is validated, your function will be called.  It will receive the
editable that was last validated as the first argument, and a boolean
indicating whether or not the editable failed validation as the second
argument.

*Example:*

<javascript>
	Aloha.settings.plugins.validation = {
		onValidation: function (editable, isValid) {
			if (isValid) {
				editable.obj.removeClass('validation-failed');
			} else {
				editable.obj.addClass('validation-failed');
			}
		}
	}
</javascript>

WARNING: @onValidation@ must be a function.

h4. *@enabled@*

As with other Aloha Editor plugins, it is possible to disable the use of validation
by setting the @enabled@ property to @false@.

h3. validate(): Manual validation

It is also possible to manually trigger validation when automatic triggers are
not suitable using the @Validation.validate()@ function.

The @validate()@ function call be called with a single editable, or a list of
editables.  All editable that are given to the function will be validated.  If
nothing is passed into the function then all available editables will be
validated.  This is useful for doing such things are pre-saving validation in
your application.

@validate()@ returns a set of all editable that failed validation.

*Example:*

<javascript>
	if (Aloha.features.validation) {
		Aloha.require(['validation/validation-plugin'], function (Validation) {
			var failures = Validation.validate();
			if (failures.length) {
				console.error(failures.length + ' editables failed validation.');
			} else {
				console.log('All editables are valid.');
			}
		});
	}
</javascript>

NOTE: Notice that you can determine whether or not the @extra/validation@
plugin is loaded and enabled based on whether the @Aloha.features.validation@
flag is set to @true@.
