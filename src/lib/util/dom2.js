	 *   elements in the result set should be handled differently, the
	 *   subsequent hasClass('.class1') and hasClass('.class2') calls

	 *

	 *   slow on IE7 compared to just iterating over

	 *
	 * * $('name.class') is much faster than just $('.class'), but as

	 * matter how many entries there are in classMap to index.

	 *   name, name').
	 *
	 * * On IE7, $root.find('name, name, name, name') is extemely slow
	 *   (can be an order of magnitude slower than individual calls to
	 *    getElementsByTagName, why is that?).
	 *
	 * * Although getElementsByTagName is very fast even on IE7, when
	 *   names.length > 7 an alternative implementation that iterates
	 *   over all tags and checks names from a hashmap (similar to how
	 *   indexByClass does it) may become interesting, but
	 *   names.length > 7 is unlikely.
	 *
	 * This function only makes sense if the given names array has many
	 * entries. For only one or two different names, calling $('name')
	 * or context.getElementsByTagName(name) directly is fine (but
	 * beware of $('name, name, ...') as explained above).
	 *
	 * The signature of this function differs from indexByClass by not
	 * taking a map but instead an array of names.
