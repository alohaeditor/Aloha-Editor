/**
 * Tree walking functions.
 *
 * prewalk(form, fn, leaf)
 *
 *     Descend into the given tree and build a new tree with the result
 *     of applying the given function to each branch and leaf.
 *
 *     An optional leaf function will be applied only to the leaves of
 *     the tree before being applied to the given function.
 *
 *     The given function is applied as the tree is descended into - the
 *     function application (pre)cedes descending into the tree.
 *
 * postwalk(form, fn, leaf)
 *
 *     The same as prewalk, except the given function is applied as
 *     the tree is ascended.
 *
 * preprune(form, pred, leaf)
 *
 *     The same as prewalk, except fn is a predicate function and any
 *     branch or leaf that is encountered and for which pred returns
 *     true is removed from the tree.
 *
 * postprune(form, pred, leaf)
 *
 *     The same as preprune, except the predicate function is applied as
 *     the tree is ascended.
 *
 * leaves(form, leaf)
 *
 *     Invokes the given leaf function for each leaf in the tree.
 *
 * flatten(form)
 *
 *     Makes an array of all leaves in the tree.
