/**
 * Tree walking functions.
 *
 * prewalk(form, fn, inplace)
 *
 *     Descend into the given form, which is a tree of arrays andmaps
 *     (javascript Object), and build a new tree with the result of
 *     applying the given fn to each branch and leaf. Only arrays and
 *     maps are descended into, everything else is considered a leaf.
 *
 *     The given fn is applied as the tree is descended into - the
 *     function application (pre)cedes descending into the tree.
 * 
 *     By default, an entirely new structure is returned. If the
 *     optional inplace argument is true, the algorithm will not
 *     allocate any new structures, but modify the given form in-place.
 *     The benefit of this is more performance due to less allocation,
 *     and reduced memory overhead, but see the "Note" below.
 *
 * postwalk(form, fn, inplace)
 *
 *     the same as prewalk, except the given fn is applied as the tree
 *     is ascended.
 *
 * preprune(form, pred, inplace)
 *
 *     the same as prewalk, except pred is a predicate function and any
 *     branch or leaf that is encountered and for which pred returns
 *     true is removed from the tree.
 *
 * postprune(form, pred, inplace)
 *
 *     the same as preprune, except the predicate function is applied as
 *     the tree is ascended.
 *
 *     Postpruning is potentially slower than prepruning since it always
 *     descendes into the whole tree, even into pruned nodes, while
 *     prepruning skips any pruned nodes.
 *
 * leaves(form, leaf, inplace)
 *
 *     Like postwalk, except the leaf function is applied only to
 *     leaves, and not to the arrays or maps that make up the tree
 *     structure of form.
 *
 *     Useful when one is only interested in tranforming leaves.
 *
 * flatten(form)
 *
 *     Makes an array of all of the given form's leaves.
 *
 * clone(form)
 *
 *     Constructs a deep clone of the given form.
 *
 * prepruneDom(form, pred, inplace)
 *
 *     Like preprune() except:
 *
 *     - the given form may be either an element or other DOM node, and
 *       only elements are descended into, all other node types are
 *       considered leaves.
 *
 *     - the given form will be cloned before it is being traversed, unless
 *       inplace is true.
 *
 *       This is different from prewalk, where the subforms that are
 *       passed to fn are not clones. Making a deep clone first
 *       simplifies some things, basically because an array or map can
 *       be the child of multiple arrays and maps at the same time,
 *       while a node can only be the child of a single parent node at
 *       any one time.
 *   
 * postpruneDom(form, pred, inplace)
 *
 *     Like prepruneDom(), except the given function is applied as the tree
 *     is ascended.
 *
 * walk(form, recurse, inplace)
 *
 *     If form is an array or map, calls recurse on each of its items.
 *     If inplace is true, modifies the form and sets each item to the
 *     result of the call to recurse. If inplace is false, creates a new
 *     array/map containing the results of calling recurse. Returns
 *     either form if inplace is true, or the newly created array/map.
 *
 *     If form is not an array or map, it is simply returned.
 *
 * walk(form, recurse)
 *
 *     Short for walk(form, recurse, true)
 *
 * walkDomInplace(form, recurse)
 *
 *     Similar to walk() but operates on DOM nodes.
 *
 *     Elements are considered non-leaf, and everything else is
 *     considerd a leaf.
 *
 * Note: All functions work on array+map trees, unless they are suffixed
 *       with Dom, in which case they only work on DOM nodes.
 *
 * Note: When walking arrays and maps, if the fn and leaf functions
 *       modify the parent or any ancestor of the passed form, the
 *       resulting behaviour is undefined. Only modification of the
 *       passed form and descendants of the passed form is valid.
 *
 *       During DOM traversal, it is allowed to insert-into/remove-from
 *       the children of the parent of the given form, as long the given
 *       form itself is not removed.
 *
 * Note: the algorithms are recursive and the maximum nesting level of
 *       the input set is therefore bound to the maximum stack depth.
 *       IE7 and IE8 for example have a maximum stack depth of greater
 *       than 1000, so the maximum input nesting level should not exceed
 *       about 300 (3 stack frames are needed per nesting level).
