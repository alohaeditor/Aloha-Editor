/**
 * Implements some logic related to moving the cursor keys across blocks.

 * In the following example
 *
 * "some text<span class="aloha-block ..." contenteditable="false" ...>...</span>[]some text"
 *
 * when one moves the cursor indicated by "[]" to the left, the entire
 * non-contenteditable block is skipped. The same for moving the cursor
 * right across the block.
 *
 * TODO: actually, the block shouldn't be skipped, it should be
 *       selected/highlighted first.
 * TODO: this file currently doesn't contain all the code to implement
 *       block jumping. Some of it is currently implemented in markup.js.

	/**
	 * Inserts a zero width text node before or after a block.
	 *
	 * There is a problem where some browsers can't select the boundary
	 * between some contenteditable content and non-contenteditable
	 * content. For example, if in the example at the top of the file
	 * the selection were one step to the right "...</span>s[]ome..."
	 * and the left cursor key were pressed, then the selection would
	 * just disappear or be stuck between the span and the text node.
	 *
	 * To work around this problem a zero width text node is inserted
	 * before or after a block.
	 *
	 * The inserted zero width text node will be removed automatically
	 * when it isn't necessary any more (on selection change or on
	 * editable.getContents()).
	 *
	 * TODO: In retrospect, a better alternative may be to simply wrap
	 *       every inlin-block with an editable span.
	 * @param block
	 *        The DOM element for a block before or after which the zero
	 *        width text node will be inserted.
	 * @param isGoingLeft
	 *        True if the zero width text node is to be inserted after
	 *        the block element, or false if the zero width text node is
	 *        to be inserted before the block element.
	 * @return
	 *        The text node that was inserted.
