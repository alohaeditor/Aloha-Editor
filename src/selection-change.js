	/**
	 * Sometimes Firefox (tested with version 25.0) changes the selection
	 * only immediatly after a mouseup (both when the listener was
	 * registered with useCapture true and false). This seems to happen only
	 * in rare cases. One way to reproduce it is to have an editable like
	 * this (just a plain editable without Aloha):
	 *
	 * <div contenteditable="true">
	 *  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br/>
	 *  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br type="_moz"/>
	 * </div>
	 *
	 * where the second line is written by just holding down the x key, and
	 * releasing it, and typing an individual x at the end of the line, and
	 * setting the selection with a mouse press after and before the last
	 * character. I think it has to do with the last character being an
	 * individual text node.
	 *
	 * The same goes for the keypress event (in both IE and Firefox and
	 * possibly others), except with the keypress event the selection
	 * seems to be never up to date, so we would always have to do
	 * it. Handling keypresses is useful to get a selection update when
	 * the user auto-repeats text-input by holding down a key. It's not
	 * a big deal however if on each keypress event the user gets the
	 * selection change caused by a previous keypress event, because the
	 * keyup event when the user releases the key will ensure a correct
	 * notification at the end of an auto-repeat sequence.
	 *
	 * Because Firefox sets the new selection immediately after the
	 * event handler returns we can use nextTick() instead of a
	 * timeout. This could lead to the handler passed to
	 * watchSelection() being called even after calling the freeing
	 * function returned by watchSelection().
	 *
	 * NB: keeping around events in a timeout in IE9 causes strange
	 * behaviour: the mouseup events are somehow played back again after
	 * they happened.

	/**
	 * Adds a handler function to events that may cause a
	 * selection-change.
	 *
	 * Our strategy
	 *
	 * Use the selectionchange event (see below) when available (Chrome,
	 * IE) and additionally hook into keyup, keypress, mouseup, touchend
	 * events (other browsers). We need keyup events even in IE to
	 * detect selection changes caused by text input. Keypress events
	 * are necessary to capture selection changes when the user is
	 * auto-repeating text-input by holding down a key, except in Chrome
	 * it's not necessary because there the selectionchange event fires
	 * on text-input (See maybeNextTick() for more information regarding
	 * auto-repeating text-input). Hooking into all events on all
	 * browsers does no harm. Touchend is probably necessary for mobile
	 * support other than webkit, although I only tested it on webkit,
	 * where it is not necessary due to selectionchange support.
	 *
	 * For programmatic selection changes we recommend programmatically
	 * firing the selectionchange event on the document element (IE7 needs
	 * the document element, but for IE9+, Chrome and Firefox triggering it
	 * on an element works too).
	 *
	 * We set useCapture to true, so that a stopPropagation call in the
	 * bubbling phase will not starve our handlers. In IE < 9 someone may
	 * still do it since useCapture is not supported.
	 *
	 * Behaviour of the 'selectionchange' event:
	 * * will be fired on every selection change, including when the user
	 *   selects something by pressing and holding the mouse button and
	 *   dragging the selection,
	 * * will not be fired when the user enters text e.g. in a content
	 *   editable in IE9 and IE10,
	 * * will be fired when the selection is set programatically in Chrome,
	 *   but not in IE9 and IE10,
	 * * works in IE as far back as IE7 and Chrome but doesn't work in Firefox or Opera.
	 * * can be feature detected with ('onselectionchange' in document).
	 *
	 * @param doc {!Document}
	 *        The document object.
	 * @param watchSelection {function(!Event):void}
	 *        A handler function like the one returned from handler().
	 * @param mousemove {boolean}
	 *        Even with all the events above hooked, we only get
	 *        up-to-date selection change updates when the user presses
	 *        the mouse and drags the selection in Chrome and IE, but
	 *        not in Firefox (and probably others). This case can be
	 *        covered by handling the mousemove event. We don't do it by
	 *        default because handling the mousemove event could have
	 *        different implications from handling up/down/press events.
	 * @return {void}
